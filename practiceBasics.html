    <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
        It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
     technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.
      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
      HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
